**OS - CPU SCHEDULING :**

Scheduling of processes/work is done to finish the work on time. CPU Scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while another process is delayed (in standby) due to unavailability of any resources such as I / O etc, thus making full use of the CPU. 
The purpose of CPU Scheduling is to make the system more efficient, faster, and fairer.
CPU scheduling is a key part of how an operating system works. It decides which task (or process) the CPU should work on at any given time.
This is important because a CPU can only handle one task at a time, but there are usually many tasks that need to be processed. 

**CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS :**

1.First Come and First Served.

2.Shortest Job First.

3.Shortest Remaining Time First.

4.Round Robin.
